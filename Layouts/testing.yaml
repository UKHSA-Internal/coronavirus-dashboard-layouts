      The government provides testing through 4 routes known as pillars. More information about the pillars can be found in the About tab. 
      
      Separate charts are shown for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests (this chart includes all lab-based virus tests) and antibody tests. 
      Lab-based virus tests test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and include all lab-based pillar 1 and 2 PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and Lampore tests and any PCR tests undertaken in pillar 4. 
      Antibody serology tests test for COVID-19 antibodies and include pillar 3 tests and any antibody serology tests undertaken in pillar 4.
