      Positive rapid lateral flow test results can be confirmed with PCR tests taken within 72 hours. If the PCR test results are negative, these are not reported as cases.
      People tested positive more than once are only counted once, on the date of

      Number of people with at least one positive COVID-19 test result. Cases are shown by type of test used in their first positive test and by specimen date.
      Positive rapid lateral flow test results can be confirmed with PCR tests taken within 72 hours. If the PCR test results are negative, these are not reported as cases.
      The test types shown are lab-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR), rapid lateral flow test (LFD) with positive PCR (this means the result has been verified
      with a positive PCR result taken within 3 days) and LFD without PCR (no positive PCR result taken within 3 days).
      People tested positive more than once are only counted once, on the date of their first positive test. Data for the period ending 5 days before 
      the date when the website was last updated with data for the selected area are incomplete. Some LFD results may change or be removed as more PCR results are reported.

    abstract: >
      Total number of people with at least one positive COVID-19 test result, either lab-reported or lateral flow device (England only) in the most 
      recent 7-day period. 
      Positive rapid lateral flow test results can be confirmed with PCR tests taken within 72 hours. If the PCR test results are negative, these are not reported as cases.
      The rates per 100,000 resident population give a fairer comparison of 
      the number of cases in each area but they do not take account of the different rates of testing 
      or differences in the age and sex of the local populations. Data shown are cases by specimen date 
      and because these are incomplete for the most recent dates, the period represented is the 7 
      days ending 5 days before the date when the website was last updated.
