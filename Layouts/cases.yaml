      Number of cases. Cases are shown by type of test used in their first positive test and by specimen date. 
      Positive rapid lateral flow test results can be confirmed with PCR tests taken within 72 hours. If the PCR test results are negative, these are not reported as cases. 
      The test types shown are lab-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR), rapid lateral flow test (LFD) with positive PCR (this means the result has been verified with a 
      positive PCR result taken within 3 days) and LFD only (no PCR taken within 3 days). Data for the last 5 days are incomplete. Some LFD results 
      may change or be removed as more PCR results are reported.

        Total number of cases in the most recent 7-day period and rate per 100,000 people. 
        Data are shown by specimen date (the date the sample was taken from the person being tested). Because data by specimen date are incomplete for the most recent dates, 
        the figures shown are for the 7 days ending 5 days before the date when the website was last updated. Definitions of cases vary by nation. For example, not all nations include lateral flow testing in their case counts.
