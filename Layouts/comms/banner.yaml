    **Change to case reporting and revision to historical case data in England**


    The way cases are reported has changed. Cases that have been identified through a positive 
    Lateral Flow Device (LFD) test will be removed for people who took Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests within 
    3 days that were all negative. x,xxx cases of this type have been removed from the cumulative total. The newly reported numbers 
    of cases for the UK and England are unaffected. However, the newly reported cases for regions and local authorities in England are affected
    by the removal of these cases, and will show significantly lower numbers or zero. These should not be considered as the actual number of new cases reported.
