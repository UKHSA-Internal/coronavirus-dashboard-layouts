    **Improved local authority allocation for deaths in England.** Some deaths previously reported in England have been reallocated to different resident local authorities. 
    Total deaths for England are unaffected, but some local authorities and regions will show inaccurate daily reported numbers because of this change.

    **Revision to historical case data in England.** 
    The introduction of a new system disrupted the removal of cases where a positive rapid lateral flow test (LFD) was followed by all negative laboratory
    (PCR) tests taken within 3 days, as reported yesterday. Therefore a further 561 cases have been removed today. Regions and local authorities do not 
    show the actual number of new cases reported. UK and England numbers of newly reported cases have been adjusted and correctly reflect new cases reported.
    This issue will be ongoing over the next few days.

    **Change to case reporting and revision to historical case data in England.**

    UK and England numbers of newly reported cases have been adjusted and correctly reflect new cases reported. [**More**](/details/whats-new)
