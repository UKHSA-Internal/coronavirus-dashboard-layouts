      Daily counts of deaths in England rely on multiple data sources. On 13 March 2021 
      there was a delay in receiving this information from one of these sources. This 
      might have a small impact on the total number of deaths reported on that date. This 
      delay will be reflected on the numbers published on 14 March 2021.
