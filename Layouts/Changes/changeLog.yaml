      Following clinical validation work in Wales, three individuals previously
      reported as having died within 28 days of a positive test result have been

      Public Health Scotland has improved its method for linking daily confirmed 
      COVID-19 cases with deaths reported through the National Records of Scotland. 
      As a result, an extra 172 deaths were identified as having occurred 
      within 28 days of a first positive test result since the start of the outbreak. 
      These have now been added to the cumulative totals for Scotland and the UK.
