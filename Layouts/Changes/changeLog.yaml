    body: > 
      On 27 March 2021, 850 historic cases were removed from the dashboard. Due to a laboratory 
      processing error these tests were reported as positive when they should have been recorded 
      as void. This affected specimen dates between 23 and 25 March in local authorities primarily 
      in the North East and Yorkshire. The cumulative total number of people tested positive was 
      revised down on 27 March 2021. Historic published date totals have not been changed.

      The percentage uptake published here for the nations of the UK may differ from those reported by the nations individually. In particular, 
      figures published by Public Health Wales use denominators of those registered with NHS Wales rather than mid-year population estimates.

    body: > 
      The figure for weekly deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate by date registered in the UK has increased by 946 deaths. 
      This is due to the inclusion of deaths of non-residents for England and Wales during 2020.

      We have updated the patients in hospital figures on this site to align

      with this change.
    details: |
      Previously the number of patients in hospital had only included patients 
      in acute trusts with a type 1 A&E department, this has now been extended 
      to include all acute trusts, mental health trusts and independent sector 
      providers.
