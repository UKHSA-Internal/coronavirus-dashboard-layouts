    headline: Change to source of pillar 2 PCR tests data in England
    body: |
      The data source of pillar 2 PCR tests conducted for England has changed. 
      Previously, the number of tests conducted was collated daily from individual laboratories in England based on the day the test was processed. 
      These data are now supplied by NHS Test and Trace digital management information systems, using the date that the test was taken (specimen date). 
      This difference in the way the tests are being reported has resulted in a small revision to the cumulative total PCR virus tests conducted for the UK and England. 
      The historical daily series for England and the UK have not been revised. 
      This new source aligns with that used in the [weekly statistics for NHS Test and Trace](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-weekly-reports), 
      and with that used for rapid lateral flow (LFD) tests.

      Northern Ireland have switched to a new vaccinations management system (Northern Ireland Vaccinations Management System) 
      which provides a greater level of detail about the vaccination programme. It replaces the previous manual system which relied on a 
      variety of platforms with differing reporting mechanisms.
      
      In developing the system, some data have been amended, however the overall total is consistent. 
      This includes re-classifying a small percentage of first doses as second doses, reflecting the improved data accuracy of the new system.

    headline: Patients in hospital figures aligned with NHS England
    body: > 
      We have updated the patients in hospital figures on this site to align 
      them with NHS England publications and the other measures of healthcare 
      on the dashboard. UK totals and historic data has been revised in line 
      with this change.
    details: |
      Previously the number of patients in hospital had only included patients 
      in acute trusts with a type 1 A&E department, this has now been extended 
      to include all acute trusts, mental health trusts and independent sector 
      providers.
