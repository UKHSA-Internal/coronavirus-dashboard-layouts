      Confirmed COVID-19 patients in mechanical ventilation beds. Data from the four nations may not be
      directly comparable as data about COVID-19 patients in hospitals are collected differently. Data
      are not reported by each nation every day and England data are not available before 2 April. The
      UK figure is the sum of the four nations' figures and can only be calculated when all nations'
