      The estimated R value (transmission rate) and daily infection growth rate. The reproduction number (R) 
      is the average number of secondary infections produced by a single infected person. The infection growth rate 
      is an approximation of the percentage change in the number of infections each day and indicates how quickly 
      the number of infections is changing. Both estimates are shown as ranges, from minimum to maximum.
