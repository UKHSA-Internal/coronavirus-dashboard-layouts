      The number of people of all ages who have received a COVID-19 vaccination, shown as a percentage of the population 
      aged 12 and over. First and second doses are shown. The denominator is the 2020 mid-year population estimate for those 
      aged 12 and over. A different denominator is used for England local areas and age demographics by vaccination date so 
      these cannot be compared.
      Percentages lower than 0.1 will not appear on the chart and show as N/A in data tables.

      Latest total percentage of people aged 12 and over who have received a COVID-19 vaccination, by dose. 
      For English areas, the denominator is the number of people aged 12 and over on the National Immunisation Management 
      Service (NIMS) database. For Scottish areas, the denominator is the mid-2020 population estimate for those aged 12 
      and over. This means comparisons between local areas in different nations should be made with caution. England local 
      area uptake is also not comparable to England national uptake by report date as that uses a different denominator – see 
      the About tab for more information. England and Scotland totals by vaccination date are shown for comparison purposes 
      calculated on the same basis as their constituent regions and local authorities.

      Latest total percentage of people aged 12 and over who have received a COVID-19 vaccination, by dose. 
      For English areas, the denominator is the number of people aged 12 and over on the National Immunisation Management 
      Service (NIMS) database. For Scottish areas, the denominator is the mid-2020 population estimate for those aged 12 
      and over. This means comparisons between local areas in different nations should be made with caution. England local 
      area uptake is also not comparable to England national uptake by report date as that uses a different denominator – see 
      the About tab for more information. England and Scotland totals by vaccination date are shown for comparison purposes 
      calculated on the same basis as their constituent regions and local authorities.
      Percentages lower than 0.1 will not appear on the chart and show as N/A in data tables.
