      Total percentage of people aged 18 and over who have received a COVID-19 vaccination, 
      by dose, up to the latest day on which vaccine data were reported.
      Daily figures include all vaccines that were given up to and including the date shown.
      For English areas, only people who have an NHS number and are currently alive are included. The denominator
      used is the number of people on the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS) database.
      For Scottish areas, the denominator used is the mid-2019 population estimate,
      published by National Records of Scotland. For this reason, comparisons should be made with caution.
